This error occurs because the remote repository (`https://github.com/mekdes47/pokedex.git`) already has some content (e.g., a README file or other changes) that your local repository does not have. Git is preventing you from overwriting those changes without integrating them first.

### **Steps to Resolve the Error**
Here‚Äôs how you can handle this situation:

---

#### **Option 1: Pull and Merge the Remote Changes**
1. Pull the remote changes to your local repository:
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```
   Replace `main` with `master` if your remote repository uses the `master` branch.

2. Resolve any merge conflicts if they occur:
   - Open the conflicting files in your text editor.
   - Make necessary edits to resolve the conflicts.
   - After resolving, stage the changes:
     ```bash
     git add .
     ```
   - Commit the merge:
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Resolved merge conflicts"
     ```

3. Push the changes back to the remote repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

---

#### **Option 2: Force Push (Not Recommended for Shared Repos)**
If you‚Äôre sure you want to overwrite the remote changes (e.g., it‚Äôs your personal repository, and no one else is working on it), you can force push:

1. Force push your local changes:
   ```bash
   git push origin main --force
   ```

   ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** This will overwrite any changes in the remote repository. Be cautious when using this option, especially in collaborative environments.

---

#### **Option 3: Rebase Your Local Branch**
If you want to integrate the remote changes while keeping your local commits clean, you can rebase:

1. Fetch the remote changes:
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   ```

2. Rebase your local branch onto the remote branch:
   ```bash
   git rebase origin/main
   ```

3. Push the changes:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

   If the rebase results in conflicts, resolve them as in Option 1 and continue the rebase:
   ```bash
   git rebase --continue
   ```

### **Best Practice**
If you're unsure, use **Option 1 (Pull and Merge)**, as it integrates remote changes without overwriting them. Let me know if you need further clarification or help resolving merge conflicts! üòä
